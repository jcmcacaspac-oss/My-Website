<h1>Midnight</h1>
<a href="/index.html">Midnight</a>
<p>In a quiet village nestled between the whispering woods and the silver-tipped hills, there lived a boy named Orion. He was a curious child, quiet in crowds but filled with questions when the world was still. While other children played games in the sun, Orion waited for nightfall.

He had always felt a strange pull toward the stars.

Each night, after the village lanterns dimmed and the houses grew quiet, Orion would sneak out of his little room, climb the grassy hill just beyond the trees, and sit beneath the sky. It became his secret place, where only the moon and the crickets knew his name.

But this night—this midnight—was different.

The sky was deeper than usual, a velvet sea stitched with light. The stars seemed to pulse, to dance, to hum with an energy that tugged at Orion’s heart. He lay in the grass, wide-eyed, the cool breeze brushing over him like the breath of a sleeping giant.

And then he saw it.

A cluster of stars, far brighter than the rest, forming shapes he had never noticed before—like wings, or a key, or maybe a doorway. They shimmered, not just with light, but with intention, as if they were watching him in return.

Suddenly, the world around him fell silent.

No wind. No insects. No rustling trees. Only the stars... and a voice.

It was not loud. It did not speak like humans do. It sounded like music, and yet felt like a memory.

"Orion... dreamer of stars, watcher of skies... are you ready?"

He sat up, heart racing. “Ready for what?”

The stars swirled, and from their light stepped a figure—shimmering, faceless, tall as a shadow yet glowing like a lantern in the dark. Its voice echoed inside his chest.

"To remember who you are."

And just like that, the hill fell away, and Orion was lifted—not in body, but in spirit—into the night sky. He soared past clouds, past the moon, past the edge of dreaming itself. He saw things no child had ever seen: cities of light nestled on asteroid gardens, whales of stardust gliding through cosmic oceans, and great trees that floated in silence, their leaves galaxies of their own.

Memories flooded him. Not of this life, but others.

He had been here before. In lifetimes long forgotten, he had walked among stars, danced on Saturn’s rings, whispered to black holes, and mapped the songs of the universe. The stars knew him. They had waited for him to remember.

But even the longest night must end.

Gently, the figure of starlight guided him back to the hilltop, the stars fading back into their familiar patterns, the breeze returning, the crickets chirping once more.

“Was it real?” he whispered, unsure if he had dreamed it all.

The stars flickered softly in reply.

That night, Orion didn’t return to his bed. He stayed on the hill, watching the sky until the first light of dawn painted the world in gold.

From that midnight on, Orion was changed. He didn’t speak of it—not because he was afraid, but because he understood. Some things are meant to be felt, not explained. He still climbed the hill each night, still watched the stars. But now, he didn’t just look at them.

He listened.

And sometimes, when the wind was just right and the sky was very still, he would smile—because he could hear them singing his name.</p>
