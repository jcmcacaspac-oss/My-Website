<h1>Castle in the middle of the forest</h1>
<a href="/index.html">Return</a>
<p>In a land where the mountains kissed the sky and the trees whispered the stories of old, there stood a castle hidden deep within an ancient forest. No path led to it, and no map marked its place. Shrouded in mist and mystery, it rose from the treetops like a dream carved in stone—towers of pale marble, rooftops pointed toward the stars, and windows glowing like lanterns in the dusk.

This was not a castle of kings or warlords. It was known only to those the forest allowed in. Many travelers claimed to have seen it from afar, only to blink and find nothing but trees. To all others, it was a legend. But the forest knew better. The castle was alive with purpose—and it had a heart.

Inside its walls lived a girl named Liora. She was no princess, yet the birds followed her flight like a queen’s banner. Raised by the wardens of the forest, a small order of caretakers and mystics, she had learned to listen—not with her ears, but with her spirit. She could hear the sadness of the old trees, the laughter of the wind, and the soft, steady heartbeat of the land. The castle and the forest had claimed her as their own.

One stormy night, when thunder rolled like giants arguing in the heavens, the forest brought her a stranger. He was a boy—barely older than Liora—soaked to the bone, half-conscious, and cradled by the roots of an old oak as if the forest itself had sheltered him. Liora found him at dawn, led by the gentle pull of the trees.

He called himself Kaelen. A runaway prince. He had fled his father, the high king of a far-off land, who sought to wage war beyond the mountains. Kaelen had refused to raise a sword in a war he did not believe in, and for that, he had been hunted. The forest had granted him refuge, and the castle had opened its gates.

As he healed, Kaelen found comfort in the silence of the woods and the kindness in Liora’s eyes. She showed him the secret beauty of the forest—waterfalls that glittered like silver threads, trees that swayed to unheard music, and hidden glades where flowers bloomed in winter. In return, he spoke of distant kingdoms and stars charted in the night sky, of places Liora had only read about in old books.

Their bond grew, quiet and deep, like roots beneath the earth. Yet the forest watched, knowing that peace could not last.

Beneath the castle, guarded by spells and silence, lay a secret—the Verdant Flame. It was a living crystal, ancient and glowing with the magic of nature itself. It was the heart of the forest and the reason the castle still stood. But the flame was flickering, dimming with each year. The balance between the wild and the world beyond was breaking.

And then, the storm came—not from the sky, but from beyond the mountains.

Kaelen’s father had found him. An army gathered at the forest’s edge, bearing fire and iron. A warning was sent: return the prince, or the forest would burn. Liora watched the horizon from the highest tower, the skies dark with smoke from distant camps. The forest moaned, sensing danger it had not felt in centuries.

Kaelen stood beside her. He knew what he had to do.

He offered himself—not to the army, but to the Verdant Flame.

In a ritual older than memory, Kaelen gave his spirit to the forest. Liora, unwilling to lose him, joined him. Together, they became the flame’s new guardians—flesh and soul merged with the magic of the land.

When the army marched into the forest, the trees closed ranks. The earth trembled. Vines as thick as chains tore through the soil. The river rose in fury. And the castle, once silent, rang with a sound like the tolling of ancient bells. It was not a place of war, but it would not fall.

The army never reached the gates. They vanished into the wild, and were never seen again.

Years passed. Then decades. The world beyond the mountains changed. Cities rose. Kingdoms fell. But the castle in the middle of the forest remained, timeless and hidden.

Some say they can still see it, high on the cliffs, glowing with soft light in the evening mist. That if you listen closely near the edge of the old woods, you can hear laughter, or the notes of a song that doesn't belong to any age.

And they say that deep within the forest, the Verdant Flame still burns—kept alive by two souls who once chose love and magic over war and crowns.

The castle waits. The forest dreams.
And the heart of the world still beats.</p>
